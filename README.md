How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  When creating programs one must always strive to follow current best practices, including spacing, clearly named variables & databases, and in-line comments. Working with the CRUD python module allowed for each function of the program to be clearly separated and labeled, this allows for easier updating when needed.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  When approaching a problem with a computer scientist mindset, I try and consider the technical solutions available. I must consider how complex the problem at hand is, and how it can be solved through the use of technology and algorithms. When working on future databases and projects I feel the most beneficial take away from this course is continuing to follow best practices and keep the code clear and concise.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Computer scientists solve complex problems through the use of technology and algorithms. This is beneficial as AI and programs can be created to solve problems quicker and more efficiently than humans can solve the same problem. The work done on this type of project can help companies to provide clean and intuitive user interfaces to their clients and customers.
